# Authentication in AskTheCode Plugin

To ensure a seamless experience with the AskTheCode plugin, users are required to authenticate.

## Authentication Methods

1. **Passwordless Login via Email**  

This method allows users to quickly start exploring the features of the AskTheCode plugin without the need for a password. It's a hassle-free way to get started, especially for those who are new to the plugin and want to explore its capabilities. However, this method is recommended for exploration purposes only.

2. **GitHub OAuth Authentication**  

Authenticating with your GitHub account unlocks additional features, such as the ability to ask questions about private repositories. For an enhanced experience and to take full advantage of the plugin's capabilities, we recommend using the GitHub OAuth method.

# Authentication in AskTheCode Plugin

To ensure a seamless experience with the AskTheCode plugin, users are required to authenticate.

## Authentication Methods

1. **Passwordless Login via Email**  

This method allows users to quickly start exploring the features of the AskTheCode plugin without the need for a password. It's a hassle-free way to get started, especially for those who are new to the plugin and want to explore its capabilities. However, this method is recommended for exploration purposes only.

2. **GitHub OAuth Authentication**  

Authenticating with your GitHub account unlocks additional features, such as the ability to ask questions about private repositories. For an enhanced experience and to take full advantage of the plugin's capabilities, we recommend using the GitHub OAuth method.

## Managing Your Account and Subscription

To manage your account, subscription plan, and view your quota:

1. Visit the [Account Management Page](https://c7d59216ee8ec59bda5e51ffc17a994d.auth.portal-pluginlab.ai/pricing).
2. Here, you can view your current quota and available subscription plans.
3. To manage your current subscription, click on the **Manage subscription** icon located at the top-right corner of the page.

## Changing the Authentication Method

To change the authentication method, you indeed need to reinstall the plugin. When you install it, it will ask you to log in and will show you the authentication page:

On this page, you can press the "Change account" link, and you'll be redirected to the main Login page. It's important to note that GitHub caches the account you have previously used, so you might need to clear cookies for the github.com domain to see the prompt again.
